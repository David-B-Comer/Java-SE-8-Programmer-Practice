     The exam creators pick most of the methods developers use in the real world.
     For all these methods, you need to remember that a string is a sequence of characters
     and Java counts from 0 when indexed.



     length()
     The method length() returns the number of characters in the String. The method signature is as follows:
     int length()
     The following code shows how to use length():
     String string = "animals";
     System.out.println(string.length()); // 7
     Wait. It outputs 7? Didn’t we just tell you that Java counts from 0? The difference is
     that zero counting happens only when you’re using indexes or positions within a list. When
     determining the total size or length, Java uses normal counting again.
