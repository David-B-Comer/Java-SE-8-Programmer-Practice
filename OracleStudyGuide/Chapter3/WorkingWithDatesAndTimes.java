    /**

     In Java 8, Oracle completely revamped how we work with dates and times. You can still
     write code the “old way,” but those classes aren’t on the exam. We’ll mention the “old way”
     in real-world scenarios so that you can learn the “new way” more easily if you fi rst learned
     Java before version 8. Even if you are learning Java starting with version 8, this will help
     you when you need to read older code. Just know that the “old way” is not on the exam.
     As with an ArrayList, you need an import statement to work with the date and time classes.
     Most of them are in the java.time package. To use it, add this import to your program:
     import java.time.*; // import time classes
     In the following sections, we’ll look at creating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times.
