     Understanding an ArrayList
     An array has one glaring shortcoming: you have to know how many elements will be in the
     array when you create it and then you are stuck with that choice. Just like a StringBuilder,
     ArrayList can change size at runtime as needed. Like an array, an ArrayList is an ordered
     sequence that allows duplicates.
     As when we used Arrays.sort, ArrayList requires an import. To use it, you must have
     either of the following two statements in your class:
     import java.util.* // import whole package including ArrayList
     import java.util.ArrayList; // import just ArrayList
     Remember that if you are shown a code snippet with a line number that doesn’t begin
     with 1, you can assume the necessary imports are there. Similarly, you can assume the
     imports are present if you are shown a snippet of a method.
     In this section, we’ll look at creating an ArrayList, common methods, autoboxing,
     conversion, and sorting.
     Experienced programmers, take note: This section is simplified and doesn’t cover a
     number of topics that are out of scope for the OCA exam.
