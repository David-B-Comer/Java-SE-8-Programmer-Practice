     1 + 2 is clearly 3. But what is "1" + "2"? It’s actually "12" because Java combines the two String objects.
     Placing one String before the other String and combining them together is called string
     concatenation. The OCA exam creators like string concatenation because the + operator
     can be used in two ways within the same line of code. There aren’t a lot of rules to know for
     this, but you have to know them well:
     1. If both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition.
     2. If either operand is a String, + means concatenation.
     3. The expression is evaluated left to right.
