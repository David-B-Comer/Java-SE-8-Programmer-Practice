    /**

    Once a String object is created, it is not allowed to change. It cannot be made larger or
    smaller, and you cannot change one of the characters inside it.
    You can think of a string as a storage box you have perfectly full and whose sides can’t
    bulge. There’s no way to add objects, nor can you replace objects without disturbing the
    entire arrangement. The trade-off for the optimal packing is zero fl exibility.
    Mutable is another word for changeable. Immutable is the opposite—an object that
    can’t be changed once it’s created. On the OCA exam, you need to know that String is
    immutable.
