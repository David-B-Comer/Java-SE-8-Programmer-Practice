     Arrays are objects, and of course array components can be objects. It doesnâ€™t take much
     time, rubbing those two facts together, to wonder if arrays can hold other arrays, and of
     course they can.




     Creating a Multidimensional Array
     Multiple array separators are all it takes to declare arrays with multiple dimensions. You
     can locate them with the type or variable name in the declaration, just as before:
     int[][] vars1; // 2D array
     int vars2 [][]; // 2D array
     int[] vars3[]; // 2D array
     int[] vars4 [], space [][]; // a 2D AND a 3D array

     **/
}
