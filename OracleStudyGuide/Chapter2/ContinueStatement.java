public class ContinueStatement {
    /**

     A statement that causes flow to finish the execution of the current loop.  The continue
     statement transfers control to the boolean expression that determines if the loop should
     continue. In other words, it ends the current iteration of the loop. Also like the break
     statement, the continue statement is applied to the nearest inner loop under execution
     using optional label statements to override this behavior.
