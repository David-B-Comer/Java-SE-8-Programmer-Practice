public class DoWhileStatement {
    /**

     A repetition control structure with a termination condition and statement, or block of statements.
     Unlike a while loop, a do-while loop guarantees that the statement or block will be executed at least once.

     The primary difference between the syntactic structure of a do-while loop and a while
     loop is that a do-while loop purposely orders the statement or block of statements before
     the conditional expression, in order to reinforce that the statement will be executed before
     the expression is ever evaluated.
