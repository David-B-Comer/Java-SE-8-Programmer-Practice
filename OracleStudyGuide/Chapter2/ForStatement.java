     A basic for loop has the same conditional boolean expression and statement, or block of
     statements, as the other loops you have seen, as well as two new sections: an initialization
     block and an update statement.

     Variables declared in the initialization block of a for loop have limited scope and
     are only accessible within the for loop. Be wary of any exam questions in which a variable declared within the initialization block of a for loop is available outside the loop.
     Alternatively, variables declared before the for loop and assigned a value in the initialization block may be used outside the for loop because their scope precedes the for loop
     creation.
