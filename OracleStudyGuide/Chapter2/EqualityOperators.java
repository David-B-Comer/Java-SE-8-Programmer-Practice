    /**

     The equality operators are used in one of three scenarios:
     1. Comparing two numeric primitive types. If the numeric values are of different data
     types, the values are automatically promoted as previously described. For example,
     5 == 5.00 returns true since the left side is promoted to a double.
     2. Comparing two boolean values.
     3. Comparing two objects, including null and String values.
