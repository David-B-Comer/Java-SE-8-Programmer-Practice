     A repetition control structure, which we refer to as a loop, executes a statement of code
     multiple times in succession. By using nonconstant variables, each repetition of the statement may be different. For example, a statement that iterates over a list of unique names
     and outputs them would encounter a new name on every execution of the loop.
