    /**

     Specifically designed for iterating over arrays and Collection objects. The for-each loop declaration is
     composed of an initialization section and an object to be iterated over. The right-hand side of the for-each loop
     statement must be a built-in Java array or an object whose class implements java.lang.Iterable, which includes most
     of the Java Collections framework. The left-hand side of the for-each loop must include a declaration for an
     instance of a variable, whose type matches the type of a member of the array or collection in the right-hand side
     of the statement. On each iteration of the loop, the named variable on the left-hand side of the statement is
     assigned a new value from the array or collection on the right-hand side of the statement.
