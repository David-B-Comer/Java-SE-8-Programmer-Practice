    /**

     At its core, proper Java class design is about code reusability, increased functionality,
     and standardization. For example, by creating a new class that extends an existing class,
     you may gain access to a slew of inherited primitives, objects, and methods. Alternatively,
     by designing a standard interface for your application, you ensure that any class that implements
     the interface has certain required methods defi ned. Finally, by creating abstract class
     definitions, youâ€™re defining a platform that other developers can extend and build on top of.
