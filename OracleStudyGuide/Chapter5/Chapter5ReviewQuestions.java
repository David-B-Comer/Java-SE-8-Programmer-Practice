    public class Rodent {
    protected static Integer chew() throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Rodent is chewing");

    the type of exception the parent method throws.
    C. It fails to compile because the return types are not covariant.
    D. It fails to compile because the method is protected in the parent class and public in
    the subclass.
    E. It fails to compile because of a static modifier mismatch between the two methods.
