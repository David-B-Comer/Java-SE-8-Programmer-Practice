     Calling Inherited Class Members
     Java classes may use any public or protected member of the parent class, including methods, primitives, or object references. If the parent class and child class are part of the same
     package, the child class may also use any default members defi ned in the parent class.
     Finally, a child class may never access a private member of the parent class, at least not

     member age may be accessed indirectly via a public or protected method.
     To reference a member in a parent class, you can just call it directly
