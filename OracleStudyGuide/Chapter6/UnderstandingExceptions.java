     Understanding Exceptions
     A program can fail for just about any reason. Here are just a few possibilities:
     ■ The code tries to connect to a website, but the Internet connection is down.
     ■ You made a coding mistake and tried to access an invalid index in an array.
     ■ One method calls another with a value that the method doesn’t support.
     As you can see, some of these are coding mistakes. Others are completely beyond your
     control. Your program can’t help it if the Internet connection goes down. What it can do is
     deal with the situation.
     First, we’ll look at the role of exceptions. Then we’ll cover the various types of exceptions,
     followed by an explanation of how to throw an exception in Java.
