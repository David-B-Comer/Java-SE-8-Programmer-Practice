     Applying Access Modifiers
     You already saw that there are four access modifiers: public, private, protected, and
     default access. We are going to discuss them in order from most restrictive to least restrictive:
     ■ private: Only accessible within the same class
     ■ default (package private) access: private and other classes in the same package
     ■ protected: default access and child classes
     ■ public: protected and classes in the other packages




     Private Access
     Private access is easy. Only code in the same class can call private methods or access
     private fields.
