     Writing Simple Lambdas
     Java is an object-oriented language at heart. You’ve seen plenty of objects by now. In Java
     8, the language added the ability to write code using another style. Functional programming is a way of
     writing code more declaratively. You specify what you want to do rather
     than dealing with the state of objects. You focus more on expressions than loops.
     Functional programming uses lambda expressions to write code. A lambda expression
     is a block of code that gets passed around. You can think of a lambda expression as an
     anonymous method. It has parameters and a body just like full-fl edged methods do, but it
     doesn’t have a name like a real method. Lambda expressions are often referred to as lambdas for short.
     You might also know them as closures if Java isn’t your fi rst language. If you
     had a bad experience with closures in the past, don’t worry. They are far simpler in Java.
     In other words, a lambda expression is like a method that you can pass as if it were a
     variable. For example, there are different ways to calculate age. One human year is equivalent to seven dog years.
     You want to write a method that that takes an age() method as
     input. To do this in an object-oriented program, you’d need to defi ne a Human subclass and a
     Dog subclass. With lambdas, you can just pass in the relevant expression to calculate age.
     Lambdas allow you to write powerful code in Java. Only the simplest lambda expressions are on the OCA exam.
     The goal is to get you comfortable with the syntax and the
     concepts. This means you aren’t truly doing functional programming yet. You’ll see
     lambdas again on the OCP exam.
     In this section, we’ll cover an example of why lambdas are helpful, the syntax of
     lambdas, and how to use predicates.
