     Access Modifiers
     Java offers four choices of access modifier:

     public The method can be called from any class.

     private The method can only be called from within the same class.

     protected The method can only be called from classes in the same package or subclasses.
     Youâ€™ll learn about subclasses in Chapter 5.

     Default (Package Private) Access The method can only be called from classes in the same
     package. This one is tricky because there is no keyword for default access. You simply omit
     the access modifier
